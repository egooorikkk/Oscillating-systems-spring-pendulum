The developed program is a solution for calculating and visualizing various physical parameters related to the oscillations of a spring pendulum system. 
Users can enter the weight of the load and the stiffness of the spring, after which the program calculates the oscillation period, frequency, amplitude, maximum acceleration and mechanical energy of the system using standard physical formulas. The calculation results are visualized as graphs showing the dependence of displacement, velocity, and acceleration on time, which are constructed using the Matplotlib library. These graphs are you can save it in image format for future reference.
It is also possible to export the results to an Excel file, where the values of mass, stiffness, period, frequency and other physical quantities are stored. The program allows you to send graphs by e-mail, which simplifies the process of exchanging results. To illustrate the processes taking place in the system, an animation function has been implemented that demonstrates the movement of the mass.
The program's interface is intuitive: there are text fields for data entry, buttons for calculations, clearing fields, and output. information about the program and the author. There are also dialog boxes for entering data, selecting files, and saving results. The program includes theoretical information, a user's guide, as well as information about the author and the program itself.
An important function is to save current data and graphs with the possibility of restoring them, which makes it easier to continue working with the project. Thus, the program is a fully functional tool for solving problems in the field of physics, offering the user a wide range of possibilities for calculations, visualization and data retention, which makes it useful for both students and professionals.
